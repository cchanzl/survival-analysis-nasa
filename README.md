# survival-analysis-nasa
In this repo, we aim to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of turbofan engines from the NASA turbofan engine
degradation simulation data set FD001.

This repo is divided into three main segment:
1. baseline.py - trains and test the selected centralised models
2. data_adjustment.py - perform feature engineering and the splitting of data sets for subsequent federated learning
3. nasa_eda.ipynb - exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the FD001 data set
